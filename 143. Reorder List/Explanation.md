# 📄 EXPLANATION.md – Understanding the Custom Implementation of Reorder List

This explanation walks through a custom Python implementation of the solution to Leetcode's **Problem 143: Reorder List**, where we reorder a singly linked list in a specific pattern without altering node values — only their connections.

---

## 📘 Problem Summary

Given a singly linked list:

```
L0 → L1 → … → Ln-1 → Ln
```

Reorder it to:

```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …
```

### Example:
- Input: `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Output: `1 → 5 → 2 → 4 → 3`

---

## 🧠 Approach Summary

The strategy in this implementation includes:

1. Counting the number of nodes to find the middle.
2. Splitting the list into two halves.
3. Reversing the second half.
4. Merging the two halves in the required order.

---

## 🧩 Function Breakdown

### 1. `reverse_order(head)`
A helper function that reverses a singly linked list.

```python
def reverse_order(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current != None:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev
```

### 2. `reorderList(head)`
The main function performing the reorder logic.

#### ➤ Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Count the total number of nodes to find the midpoint:**

```python
temp = head
i = 1
while temp.next != None:
    temp = temp.next
    i += 1
```

2. **Locate the mid node:**

```python
mid = i // 2
j = 1
temp1 = head
while j <= mid:
    temp1 = temp1.next
    j += 1
```

3. **Split the list into two and reverse the second half:**

```python
new_head = temp1.next
temp1.next = None
new_head = reverse_order(new_head)
```

4. **Merge the two halves alternately:**

```python
current, second = head, new_head
while second != None:
    insert = second
    second = second.next
    insert.next = None

    next_node = current.next
    current.next = insert
    insert.next = next_node

    current = current.next.next
```

## ✅ What This Code Does Right

- Splits the list at mid index accurately.
- Properly reverses the second half using a helper.
- Merges both halves without using extra space (O(1) space complexity).
- Ensures the original list is updated in-place.

---

## 📉 Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`
  - Traversing the list: `O(N)`
  - Reversing half the list: `O(N)`
  - Merging: `O(N)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`  
  No extra data structures used — operates directly on the list.

## 📌 Suggestions for Improvement

- You could simplify the midpoint logic by using the **slow and fast pointer** technique instead of counting nodes.
- Avoid using `i, j, f`-style variables unless needed — meaningful names improve readability.
- Ensure you handle edge cases such as 1-node or 2-node lists safely.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This implementation is logically correct and solves the problem within optimal constraints. A few cleanups and modern practices (like using `slow/fast pointers`) could improve clarity and performance, but your core idea is sound.

👏 Good job breaking down the problem into clear sub-tasks!
