# Explanation of the Missing Number Solution

The solution identifies the missing number in a sequence of integers from `0` to `n`, where exactly one number is missing.

## Steps Involved:

- **Calculate List Length (`n`):**  
  Determine the length of the list, which represents the largest number (`n`) in the expected range from `0` to `n`.

- **Sum Formula for First `n` Natural Numbers:**  
  Use the formula to calculate the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:  
  \[
  \Sum=n*(n+1)//2
  \]  
  This gives the expected sum of the numbers from `0` to `n`.

- **Calculate Sum of List Elements:**  
  Calculate the sum of the elements present in the input list `nums`.

- **Find the Missing Number:**  
  Subtract the sum of the list from the expected sum (calculated in the previous step).  
  The difference is the missing number in the sequence.

- **Time Complexity:**  
  The algorithm runs in linear time \(O(n)\) due to the summing of the elements in the list, ensuring efficient handling of large inputs.

## Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)  # Step 1: Get length of the list
        res = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Step 2: Calculate the expected sum using the formula
        return res - sum(nums)  # Step 3: Find the missing number
